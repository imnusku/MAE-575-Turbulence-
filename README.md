# Turbulence-Project-MAE-575
 The aim of this project was to utilize Ansys Fluent, a commercial solver, to solve a turbulent flow problem
 in a backward step geometry using three distinct Turbulence models. The performance of these models was
 then compared against the experimental data provided by Driver and Seegmiller (1985). Post-processing code is done in Matlab.
